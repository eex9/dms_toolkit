# dms_toolkit
 I wrote this in 1 file for no good reason. Have fun

-- Main -- \n
The "Top" button will pin the toolkit to the top of the screen
The "New" button will create a new enemy to track name and HP
The "Reset" button will reset the enemy selected with the selector to the left of it
The "Kill" button will toggle the selected enemy so you can track if your players have killed all of them
The "Roll" button at the bottom will roll the selected dice to the left and output to the right
I couldn't figure out a good way to completely reset the enemies so you just have to close out and reopen it

-- Initiative Tracker -- \n
The "Add" button will add the input above to the initiative tracker
The "Reset" button will reset the initiative tracker
The "Next button will move to the next person in the initiative
